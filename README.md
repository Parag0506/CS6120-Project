## Project Title: Paraphrase Detection Using Neural Networks

### Introduction
This project aims to develop neural network models to detect pairs of paraphrased texts. Paraphrasing is the act of conveying the same meaning of text through rephrasing or rearranging its contents. The detection of paraphrased text can be useful in many applications such as identifying duplicate questions on online platforms, acting as an information retrieval tool for finding answers to similarly posed questions, and plagiarism detection for academic institutions. 

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a collection of pairs of sentences, where each pair is labelled as either "paraphrased" or "not paraphrased." The dataset is publicly available and has been previously used for research in the field.

Name of the datasets:
PAWS
Quora Question Pairs (QQP)
MRCP

### Methods
Multiple embedding methods were used in the development of the neural network models for paraphrase detection. The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, F1, precision, and recall. Comparative research performance on the datasets used ranges from 70% to 80%, and the models developed in this project have comparable or higher accuracies ranging from 65% to 93%.
